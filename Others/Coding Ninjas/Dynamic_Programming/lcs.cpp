/**
 *   Dynamic Programming Notes
 * -------------------------------
 * Approach:
 * Method 1: Frame a recursive brute force approach, try to optimize it recursively
 * Method 2: You can figure out that this will take a long time for large inputs due to repetition of many nodes
 * This can be avoided by storing them. So use an array to store values every time they are calculated.
 * Method 3: This can be further optimized using top-down approach where upon analysis it can be understood that in a recursive approach
 * we go all the way back to the base case and start filling the values. Instead, we can fill the values in dp array from the base case
 * making it more efficient.
