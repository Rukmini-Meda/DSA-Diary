/**
 * Maximum Pair Sum

You are given a sequence A[1], A[2], ..., A[N], ( 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^8 , 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 ). There are two types of operations and they are defined as follows:
Update:
This will be indicated in the input by a 'U' followed by space and then two integers i and x.
U i x, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^8.
This operation sets the value of A[i] to x.
Query:
This will be indicated in the input by a 'Q' followed by a single space and then two integers i and j.
Q x y, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ N.
You must find i and j such that x ≤ i, j ≤ y and i != j, such that the sum A[i]+A[j] is maximized. Print the sum A[i]+A[j].
Input
The first line of input consists of an integer N representing the length of the sequence. 
Next line consists of N space separated integers A[i]. Next line contains an integer Q, Q ≤ 10^5, representing the number of operations. Next Q lines contain the operations.
Output
 Output the maximum sum mentioned above, in a separate line, for each Query.
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Q 2 4
Q 2 5
U 1 6
Q 1 5
U 1 7
Q 1 5
Output:

/**
 * Brute force to find two indices whose values sum is maximum can be done in O(n) optimistically for a single query.
 * Logic is to keep track of max and second max while traversing throughout the array
