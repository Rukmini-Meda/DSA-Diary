### Graphs

## Strongly connected components

- For a graph to have k strongly connected components, it will have n-k edges

- [So NP](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/graph-representation/practice-problems/algorithm/so-np-c559f406/)

## Basics

- A tree has n-1 edges
- Sum of degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges
